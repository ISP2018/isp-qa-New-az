# Answer

Q1. In software process Waterfall model is one of development methodology we're used.
    So what is true of this models.

    [✔]Progress is more easily measured, as the full scope of work is known in advance by requirements of customer.

    []Requirements of project is easy to be add/change in the development lifecycle.
    -Waterfall model is designing more straightforward. It hard to undo the current stage of your working to start from the begining.

    [✔]No working software is produced until late during the life cycle.

    []Lower risk on projects.
    -Waterfall model is useful for fixed bid high-risk projects where knowing the scope up-front is critical. The success will depend on the level of clarity achieved like time, market, etc., and a very effective change management. 

    [✔]Well understood milestones.

Q2. [Clean Code](https://www.investigatii.md/uploads/resurse/Clean_Code.pdf]) What is concept of Meaningful Names ?

    -Programer should follow some of rules and name variable, function, or class, should clearly to understand.
